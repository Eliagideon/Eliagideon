Hello
I am Andriambelosoa Elia Gideon, student at SAYNA
SAYNA is a digital school to learn the digital profession. 
I'm interested in code but I'm not a developer. 
I am learning a lot of things about the developer's job and especially how to learn it. 
Then I'm looking to collaborate in various projects with various methods around the world.
